Authors: Ryan Thomsen, Matt Ages

Learn how to protect your network using Autosnort! 

Autosnort is a program which can be used to analyze network traffic and""Autosnort is a python script that can analyze live or stored network traffic. It can look for potential issues in that traffic and suggest snort rules that will help prevent them.

Autosnort was built in python 3, using scapy to turn network traffic into usable data. We also used tkinter to create a graphical interface. With Autosnort, we could detect nmap scans, Christmas tree packets, rogue DNS requests, suspicious ports, and numerous other potential issues. If any of these are found, Autosnort will return some pre-made rule snort rule suggestions that will alleviate the potential issues found.
